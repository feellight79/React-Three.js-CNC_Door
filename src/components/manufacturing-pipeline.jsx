# Complete Manufacturing Pipeline Architecture

A complete manufacturing pipeline for converting 3D models to G-code with Open CASCADE
would typically involve the following components:

## 1. Frontend (Browser)
- User interface for model creation/upload
- Basic model visualization and editing
- Export to standard formats (OBJ, STL)
- Send models to backend for processing

## 2. Backend Server
- Receive models from frontend
- Process models using Open CASCADE
- Perform CAD operations (boolean operations, fillets, etc.)
- Prepare models for manufacturing
- Generate toolpaths
- Convert to G-code
- Store and manage manufacturing files

## 3. Open CASCADE Integration
- Would be implemented on the backend as:
  - Native C++ integration
  - Python bindings (via PythonOCC)
  - Docker container with Open CASCADE
- Provides advanced CAD functionality:
  - Solid modeling
  - Boolean operations
  - Surface operations
  - Mesh repair and optimization

## 4. Slicing/CAM Engine
- Convert 3D models to toolpaths
- Apply manufacturing parameters:
  - Layer height
  - Infill density
  - Support structures
  - Tool selection
  - Cutting speeds and feeds
- Generate optimized G-code

## 5. Manufacturing File Management
- Store and version manufacturing files
- Provide download links
- Track manufacturing history
- Support different machine types

## Implementation Considerations

1. Open CASCADE is a C++ library and not suitable for direct browser integration
2. G-code generation requires machine-specific parameters and optimization
3. A proper manufacturing pipeline would use a backend service
4. For production use, consider:
   - Using a Node.js/Python backend with Open CASCADE bindings
   - Integrating with existing slicers (Cura, Slic3r, etc.)
   - Using cloud-based CAM services
   - Implementing a job queue for processing
